# Viewfinder/iPad i18n #

This project is for people interested in helping to internationalize Viewfinder for iPad. I18n for Viewfinder is done entirely though .strings files. There is no XIB localization involved. If you can use Git and edit a text file, you can help.

There is a [mailing list to discuss any issues](http://lists.connectedflow.com/mailman/listinfo/i18n).
