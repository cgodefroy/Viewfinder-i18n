## Viewfinder/iPad i18n ##

This project is for people interested in helping to internationalize Viewfinder for iPad.

I18n for Viewfinder is done entirely though .strings files. There is no XIB localization involved.

There is a mailing list to discuss any issues at http://lists.connectedflow.com/mailman/listinfo/i18n
