	<p>To help you with your image research, Viewfinder lets you restrict your search to photos which have specific Creative Commons licenses (such as a license permitting commercial use).</p>
	<p>Tap the Info button beside the search field to select a Creative Commons license. You can further restrict the search to photos that are licensed for commercial purposes, as well as those which allow you to create derivative works.</p>
