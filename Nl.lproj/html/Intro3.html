	<h1>Copying Links to Photos</h1>
	<p>
		Viewfinder keeps a history of your image downloads so you can easily come back and copy the relevant URLs and attribution for images. If you're using a Creative Commons license be sure you link and attribute as required.
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Tap and hold</strong> on a photo to reveal the Info popover</li>
		<li><strong>Use the Info popover</strong> to copy the relevant Flickr link and image attribution.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>This information is also available from the <strong>History</strong> tab of the <strong>Downloads</strong> popover.
	
	<p class="footer">If you're ever unsure of the license for an image, you can use the Info popover to view a short description of the license terms.</p>
